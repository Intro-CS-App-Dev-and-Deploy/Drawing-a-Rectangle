# Drawing-a-Rectangle
Starting with a Case Study &amp; Paperfolding to understand parameters, variables, formulae and geometry

## Questions
- How does paper folding and origami hand skills help understand GUI Design (Graphical User Interface)?
- How do you code to different screen sizes and orientations of various Android Devices?
- Is it possible to code without the use of pixel numbers by making the computer do the arithmetic work?
- Is it possible to initiate and populate before use size() or fullScreen()?
- What are different ways of initiating and populating primitive variables?

## Expectations
- Pick a screen size & orientation
- Draw a rectangle in the middle of the canvas
- Add hardcoded and random colours
- Introduce dark & light Mode
- Introduce Night Reading Mode

## Instructions, Vocabulary, & Explanations (Including URLs and IDE Use)
- Start with a paper Case Study built on paperfolding to understand approximate faction or ratio values
- IDE Color Selector: Tools / Color Selector
- See Processing.org for additional parameters like opacity

## Blocks of code, Emphasized Functions
- Variable initiation (mimics dynamic Global Variables)
- Display code: size() or fullScreen() using width-height or displayWidth-displayHeight
- Variable Population below Display Code
- Objects ( rect() )
- Features of Objects
- Resetting feature parameters to default

## Specific Functions and Parameters emphasized here
- `background()`
- `stroke()`, `noStroke()`
- `strokeWeight()`
- `fill()`, `noFill()`
- `random()`
- using parameters for gray scale (0-255, 16-bit), hexadecimal (0-F, 16-bit), RGB (red blue green)

## Gamification or Rubric or Points
- [2 points] Change screen size & orientation to evaluate Display Geometry Ratios
- [1 point] All population or parameters are formulae of key-variables (unless display Geometry doesn't change with pixel-type numbers)
- [1 point] Introduction to Dark-Light display mode
- [1 point] Introduction to Night Reading mode
- [1 point] Clearly separated *Blocks of Code*
- [1 point] Using at least object features mentioned
- [Bonus] Additional features used and explicitly mentioned to Mr. Mercer in email or ReadMe.md so not missed accidently
  - Use Processing.org / Reference to find more
  - Start by researching previously mentioned object feature functions

## Additional Information to Answer Questions
- JAVA will communicate with the monitor or display, filling the key-variables of fullScreen() before executing the program
- Coding the Hardway: program is written *around* rect()
  - programming starts with an object (visual data)
  - introduces Advanced CS Object Orientated Programming
- Change one line and make other variables equal to that line (variable, formula, etc.)
- Resetting object feature parameters to default ensures objects that follow are not confused with previous object's parameters
- Colour Mode choices:
  - dark mode is easier readying on eyes and uses less battery
  - limiting BLUE in RGB values helps relax the mind before sleeping

## Extensions
- Drawing Rectangles will help understand parts of canvas needed for various parts of an app
